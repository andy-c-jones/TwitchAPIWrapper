# TwitchAPIWrapper

A C# Wrapper of the TwitchTV API

In order to make using the Twitch API easier this wrapper provides objects that mirror the responses coming back from version 3 of the Twitch API.
This is not a SDK. It provides no functionality other than just getting the data from Twitch.

An SDK will come when this is more mature.
